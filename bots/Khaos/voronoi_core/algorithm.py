           steps 2– 5.
        2. Search in :attr:`status_tree` for the arc :obj:`α` vertically above :obj:`point_i`. If the leaf
           representing :obj:`α` has a pointer to a circle event in :attr:`event_queue`, then this circle event is a
           false alarm and it must be deleted from :attr:`status_tree`.
        3. Replace the leaf of :attr:`status_tree` that represents :obj:`α` with a subtree having three leaves.
           The middle leaf stores the new site :obj:`point_i` and the other two leaves store the site
           :obj:`point_j` that was originally stored with :obj:`α`. Store the breakpoints

           two new internal nodes. Perform rebalancing operations on :attr:`status_tree` if necessary.
        4. Create new half-edge records in the Voronoi diagram structure for the
           edge separating the faces for :obj:`point_i` and :obj:`point_j`, which will be traced out by the two new
           breakpoints.
        5. Check the triple of consecutive arcs where the new arc for pi is the left arc
           to see if the breakpoints converge. If so, insert the circle event into :attr:`status_tree` and
